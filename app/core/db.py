Module 5 — async PostgreSQL wiring.

Kept deliberately optional at the connection level: metric-sieve, makeup-grade,
and analyze-film all still work with a cold or unreachable DB (the in-memory
matrices remain the system of record for the sieve, per the original design).
Only the athlete/evaluation persistence endpoints — and truth-report's
best-effort save of its own result — actually need the database up.
